title: About

I'm a data science lover, experienced trader.
Love to collect data, and doing data analysis.
Worked in securities company as risk manager and trader.
Majored in Financial Engineering.
Now I'm playing data for my interest, learning to do analysis in more scientific way.

Here's my first blog, sharing my research and thought.
Any comment and sharing will be welcome.
